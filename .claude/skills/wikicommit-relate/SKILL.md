name: wikicommit-relate
description: Decide with a person how two or more wiki pages relate — the same concept, one inside the other, related, distinct, or editions of one series — and record the decision so the pages are not raised as name collisions again. Use this only when someone explicitly asks to relate or deduplicate pages, or to work through the name collisions wikicommit-status reports. It writes the wiki's record of relations, so do not use it to look for duplicates or to answer what a page says — wikicommit-status and wikicommit-search do that without writing.

# wikicommit-relate

> **Paths in this file.** `references/…`, `scripts/…` and `../<other-skill>/…` are relative to this Skill's directory — the one holding this `SKILL.md`, which the runtime names when it loads the Skill — not to the repository root, because the Skills may be installed under `.claude/skills/` or `.agents/skills/`. Commands still run from the repository root, so spell the path out from there (`python <this Skill's directory>/scripts/…`). Paths starting with `.wikicommit/` are repository-root paths as before.

The wiki writes one page per entity a source names, and it recognizes an existing page only by the same Type and slug, or by a title or alias that matches exactly. A concept two sources call by different names therefore gets two pages, and two different things that share a name get pages whose names do not say which is which. Neither can be settled when a page is written: whether "Function calling" is the same concept as "Tool use" or the means that implements it is a person's call.

This Skill puts that call to a person and records it in `.wikicommit/relations.yml`. A recorded pair is no longer reported as a name collision.

## Usage

```
/wikicommit-relate <Type/slug> <Type/slug> [...]   # pages the person names
/wikicommit-relate                                 # the name collisions found in the wiki, one group at a time
```

Pages are named `<Type>/<slug>` — the form a WikiLink uses, the same in every language. A page path under `.wikicommit/entity/` is accepted too; read the identifier off it.

## The relations

The vocabulary is the thesaurus standard's (ISO 25964, and SKOS on the web). Use these words with the person.

| Relation | Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **same** | one concept under several names | Tool calling ⇔ Function calling |
| **broader** | one contains the other — a kind of it, a part of it, or an instance of it | Tool use ⊃ a specific tool-calling API |
| **related** | associated, neither the same nor one inside the other | Tool use — Sandboxing |
| **distinct** | different, despite a shared or similar name | Agent (AI) — Agent (HTTP user agent) |
| **series** | editions of one series — a yearly report, a numbered volume | the same report in 2024, 2025 and 2026 |
| **hold** | not decided now | — |

Same is the odd one out: it is one concept with several names, which in the end means one page with the other names as its `aliases`. **This Skill records a same decision but does not merge the pages** — merging is a separate step, `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate <page to keep> --merge <page> [...]`, and it refuses to merge pages with no same decision recorded. Say this to the person when they choose same.

The other four are relations *between* pages. They are written to `.wikicommit/relations.yml`, outside every page — a relation is a fact about two pages, not part of either one's text, and writing it into a page would change that page's content and send it back for review.

**Editions of one series are not distinct.** Unrelated things that share a name are distinct; editions, volumes or yearly issues of one series share a name because they belong together, and series records that. The series itself gets no page — no source describes it, so its page would rest on nothing — it is the `series` item alone. Before recording one, the editions' names are qualified by year so a reader can tell them apart (step 5).

## Processing Flow

### 1. Check the wiki

Stop with a message if `.wikicommit/config.yml` is missing (this is not a WikiCommit wiki) or if `.wikicommit/scripts/record_relation.py` or `.wikicommit/scripts/resolve_source_cache_path.py` is missing (the wiki's scripts predate this Skill; `/wikicommit-update` brings them in).

**A non-interactive run decides nothing.** Every outcome here rests on a person's answer, so when no one can answer, list what would be asked (the groups from step 2 with their material from step 3) and stop without writing.

### 2. Choose the pages

- **Named**: use the pages given. Each must exist under `.wikicommit/entity/<lang>/<Type>/<slug>.md` in some language and not be at `status: removed`; say which one does not and stop.
- **No argument**: run

  ```bash
  python .wikicommit/scripts/check_name_collisions.py
  ```

  Each `COLLISION:` line is one group of pages that answer to the same name in one language. Pairs already decided about, in any relation, are not listed (`judged_pairs_skipped` counts them). If there are none, say so and stop. Otherwise take the groups one at a time; the person may stop after any of them.

### 3. Lay out the material

For each page in the group, from its `primary_lang` version (`translation.primary_lang` in `.wikicommit/config.yml`), show the title, `aliases`, Type, `properties.description` (or the first paragraph of the body), how many sources it has and how many pages link to it.

```bash
python .wikicommit/scripts/build_survey_view.py --pages <page path> [<page path> ...]
```

prints the description, headings, backlink count and source count for each in one call; take the aliases from each page's frontmatter.

Then look in the sources for what they say about identity or inclusion — "X is also called Y", "X is a kind of Y". Read each source through its cached extraction (`python .wikicommit/scripts/resolve_source_cache_path.py`, as `/wikicommit-ask --include-source` does — including its exit `2` and `OUTSIDE:` answers, on which the source is not read at all). Quote what you find with the source it came from. **If no source says anything about it, say so in those words** — the person is then deciding on their own knowledge, and should know it.

### 4. Ask

Ask once per group, naming the pages:

```
How do these relate?
  same      — one concept under several names
  broader   — one contains the other (a kind, a part, or an instance of it)
  related   — associated, but neither the same nor one inside the other
  distinct  — different things that happen to share a name
  series    — editions of one series (a yearly report, a numbered volume)
  hold      — decide later
```

**When unsure between same and broader, do not choose same.** Treating a narrower concept as the same as a wider one loses what was particular to it once the pages are merged; two pages kept apart only stay duplicated. Say this if the person hesitates.

For broader, ask which page is the broader one. For series, ask each edition's year (take it from the sources and show where; ask when they do not say), and list the editions oldest first. For any relation, ask whether there is a reason worth keeping; record it in the person's words, or leave it out.

### 5. Record

For series, qualify the editions' names first (below), and record with the new identifiers.

```bash
python .wikicommit/scripts/record_relation.py --relation same --page <Type/slug> --page <Type/slug> [...] [--note-file <file>]
python .wikicommit/scripts/record_relation.py --relation broader --broader <Type/slug> --page <Type/slug> [...] [--note-file <file>]
python .wikicommit/scripts/record_relation.py --relation related --page <Type/slug> --page <Type/slug> [--note-file <file>]
python .wikicommit/scripts/record_relation.py --relation distinct --page <Type/slug> --page <Type/slug> [--note-file <file>]
python .wikicommit/scripts/record_relation.py --relation series --page <Type/slug> --page <Type/slug> [...] [--note-file <file>]
```

For broader, `--broader` is the containing page and each `--page` is a page it contains. For series, the pages go in series order, oldest first. Write the reason to a file and pass it with `--note-file` — it is free text, so keep it off the command line. For hold, run nothing.

The script appends one item to `.wikicommit/relations.yml` and never rewrites what is there. It refuses — and writes nothing — when a page does not exist, or when the file no longer parses as a list (a person's edit broke it; say so and stop rather than appending after the break).

#### Series: qualify the names first, then record

Every edition is named the same way: the slug ends in `-<year>`, the title in `（<year>）` (ja, zh) or `(<year>)` after a space (other languages). For each edition, first show what changes:

```bash
python .wikicommit/scripts/rename_page.py plan --page <page path> --year <year> [--base-title <lang>=<name> ...]
```

`--base-title` sets the name the year is added to, per language — use it when an edition's title carries something the others do not (a report number), so the editions end up with one name and their years. Show the person each `RENAME:` and `TITLE:` line and ask once for the whole series. On a yes, run the same command with `apply` in place of `plan` for each edition, then record the series with the new identifiers (`<Type>/<slug>-<year>`).

`apply` writes the page at the new slug in every language, takes the old one down (`removed_reason: merged`, `merged_into` the new page), records the rename in `.wikicommit/relations.yml`, rewrites every link to the old slug, points the source files' `generated_pages` at the new path and rebuilds the type indexes. A page whose slug already carries the year only has its title changed; `UNCHANGED:` means there is nothing to do. It refuses, writing nothing, when the new slug is taken; then ask the person for the name.

### 6. Report

Say, for each group, the relation decided and that it was recorded, or that it was held. Then:

- `/wikicommit-merge` commits `.wikicommit/relations.yml` (and, for a series, the renamed pages).
- A pair recorded here is no longer reported by `/wikicommit-status` as a name collision.
- For a same decision, the pages stay separate until they are merged: `/wikicommit-generate --regenerate <page to keep> --merge <other page> [...]` rebuilds the kept page from all their sources, carries the other names over as its aliases, takes the other pages down and rewrites the links to them. Ask which page to keep — the one whose title and slug should stay.
- For a series, each renamed page and translation whose title changed is back at `review_status: pending` — the title is content, and a person's sign-off covered the old one — so `/wikicommit-merge` opens a review-tracking Issue for each pending page; close the old pages' open tracking Issues after it, noting the new name. A page whose title already carried the year (only its slug changed) keeps its review status. The old slugs' URLs stop working on the published site. The translations are listed as stale until `/wikicommit-translate` runs. The old page's AI review carries over; where the title changed, `/wikicommit-status` lists it as a stale review until `/wikicommit-review` runs on the new page (a slug-only rename leaves the original's check standing). A `GROUPS:` line names a group file that still lists the old slug; change it there.
- For a distinct decision where the shared name is an alias on one side, dropping that alias or qualifying the title stops readers confusing the two; offer `/wikicommit-fix` for that.

## Notes

- **This Skill writes `.wikicommit/relations.yml`, and pages only to rename editions of a series** — through `rename_page.py`, after the person agreed to the names. It does not run Git; `/wikicommit-merge` commits the changes like any other.
- **The file is a record of people's decisions.** To revise one, edit or delete its item by hand; this Skill only appends.
